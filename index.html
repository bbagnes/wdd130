    <p>Hello. My name is Brigham Bagnes, and I live in Holladay City, Utah. I enjoy reading, hiking, and Family History. I am interested in learning programming with the hopes that I can work for FamilySearch and help make their website and its functionality even better.</p>

    <p>The state of Utah was founded in 1896, but Utah wasn't it's original name. It's territory was originally intended to be far larger; incorporating portions of seven adjoining states; and to be called the state of Deseret. Deseret is another name for a honey bee, and signifies industry; which is why a beehive is still included on the flag of Utah even today. The name "Deseret" and its meaning were given to the region by its first inhabitants of European descent in 1847; pioneers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who migrated west seeking religious freedom and safety from persecution. At that time, the region still belonged to Mexico, but was won from them by the United States at the end of the Mexican-American war in 1848. After the war, many pioneers of other faiths also came west, adding to the diversity of the region, and shaping the culture of the state that is known as Utah today.</p>
